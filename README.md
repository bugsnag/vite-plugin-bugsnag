  <h1>Vite plugins for common BugSnag actions</h1>
</div>

## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev vite-plugin-bugsnag
```

## Usage

### Build reporter plugin

Reports your build to BugSnag. This plugin hooks into the `buildEnd` event once all output files have been generated by the Vite compiler. If anything causes the compilation to fail before this step, the build report will not be sent.

Please see our [documentation](https://docs.bugsnag.com/build-integrations/vite/#reporting-builds) for further details.

### Sourcemap uploader plugin

Upload your application's sourcemap(s) to BugSnag. When Vite is done producing output, this plugin detects sourcemaps for any output chunks and uploads them to BugSnag.

Please see our [documentation](https://docs.bugsnag.com/build-integrations/vite/#uploading-source-maps) for further details.
